Password Generator with Javascript

<h1>Tittle: Password Generator with Javascript</h1>

<h3>Objective: to create a function with Javascript</h3>
 This homework was created for Rutegers Univeristy Bootcamp. We wanted<br>
an application that would apply a way to create a safe and secure passord<br>
to individualss


<h2> Code that was already provided for this assignment</h2>
<p> An event listener was given to us so that when a button was pushed, it would execute a function when the mouse was licked. Another function was given to us labeled "function generatePassword()" which most of the information we will do later be inside of. This function will execute when the generateBtn.addEventListener("click", writePassword) 
</p>



<h2>Process in doing Creating my Password Generator</h2>
<ul>
    <li> One must have patience beceause tasks can take a long time</li>
    <li> Write some pseudocode or notes somewhere to map at what you want to do</li>
    <li> This code will include variables in order to store information</li>
    <li> Variables with names like lowerCase, upperCase, numbers, and characters will be a good start. Inside of these variables we would like to have the alphabet of upper and lower case, number and special characters on top of the keyboard.</li>
    <li> After a long string was made inside the variables, we must prompt a user to input information that would require them to place a required password length they want that is between 8 and 128.</li>
    <li>We must make the user choose what kind of characters they want so we have to make a confirm(), to pop up a specific message. The answer to will be stored into a variable so we can compare later to a condition.
    <li>Once all choices like upperCase, lowercase, numbers and characters are selected. One must use these inputs which are stored in varibales. to compare if they are true </li>
    
</ul>
